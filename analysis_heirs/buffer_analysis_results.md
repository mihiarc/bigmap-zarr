# FIA Plots and Heirs Property Analysis Results

## Summary of Findings

1. **Direct Intersections**: 
   - 88 plots (0.36% of heirs properties)

2. **Buffer Analysis**:
   - 0.25km: 2,144 plots (4.06% of all plots)
   - 0.5km: 4,929 plots (9.33% of all plots)
   - 1km: 11,644 plots (22.04% of all plots)
   - 3km: 31,841 plots (60.28% of all plots)
   - 5km: 41,713 plots (78.97% of all plots)

This shows a clear pattern:
1. Even at very close distances (250m), we capture more than 10x the number of plots compared to direct intersections
2. There's a significant jump between 1km and 3km buffers (from 22% to 60%)
3. The rate of increase slows down after 3km (only about 19% more plots when expanding from 3km to 5km)

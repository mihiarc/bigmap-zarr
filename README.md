# Heirs Property Analysis - North Carolina

## Project Overview
This project analyzes heirs property parcels in North Carolina, focusing on land management patterns and forest health indicators. Heirs' properties are lands that have been passed down informally from generation to generation, often resulting in fractioned ownership that can impact land management decisions.

## Project Objectives
- Identify and analyze heirs property parcels in North Carolina
- Compare forest management practices between heirs and non-heirs properties
- Assess forest health indicators across different property types
- Analyze land use patterns and management decisions

   - Group related changes together.

4. **For Each Feature/Change, Document**:
   - What was changed.
   - Why it was changed.
   - How it works.
   - Any limitations or considerations.

5. **If Unsure About Documentation**:
   - Err on the side of over-documenting.

     ```

2. **When Examining Code or Error Logs**:
   - Report findings using this format:  
     ```
     Reviewed [file/section]: [relevant findings]
     ```

3. **Include Minimal Context for Current Task**:
   - Ensure findings directly inform the current task at hand.

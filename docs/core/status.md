# Project Status

## Current Phase: Phase 2 (Analysis Prototype)

### Recent Achievements
1. Data Preparation
   - Successfully processed all property data with GEOS 3.10.6
   - Implemented robust geometry validation
   - Created efficient WKT-based storage format

2. Property Matching
   - Completed matching for Vance County properties
   - Achieved 100% coverage with high-quality matches
   - Implemented efficient spatial search with two-stage filtering
   - Generated comprehensive match statistics

3. NDVI Processing
   - Split processing into modular components:
     - MosaicCreator for efficient NDVI mosaicking
     - NDVITrendAnalyzer for temporal analysis
   - Implemented memory-efficient virtual rasters (VRT)
   - Added parallel processing with automatic CPU scaling
   - Enhanced progress tracking and error handling
   - Improved data management and statistics collection
   - Enhanced property ID tracking and validation
   - Strengthened spatial data lineage

### Processing Statistics
- Data Processing:
  - 24,349 heirs properties processed
  - 5,556,642 parcels processed
  - 1.63GB total processed data
  - 99.95% processing success rate

- Property Matching:
  - 92,342 total matches found
  - 92.3 average matches per property
  - 1,137.6m average distance
  - 0.97 average area ratio
  - 100% coverage for Vance County

- NDVI Processing:
  - Memory-efficient VRT mosaics for 2018, 2020, 2022
  - Optimized property filtering using NDVI coverage bounds
  - Processing only properties within NDVI coverage (102 properties)
  - Parallel processing with CPU-optimized workers
  - Batch-based property processing (100 properties/batch)
  - Comprehensive trend statistics and validation
  - Separate storage for trends and yearly data

### Next Steps
1. NDVI Processing
   - Monitor parallel processing performance
   - Fine-tune batch sizes for optimal performance
   - Implement checkpointing for long-running jobs
   - Consider extending coverage to other counties

2. Statistical Analysis
   - Compare NDVI trends between heirs vs neighbor properties
   - Analyze temporal patterns
   - Generate visualization outputs
   - Create summary reports

### Known Issues
- NDVI coverage limited to subset of Vance County (102 properties)
- Memory usage spikes during large batch processing
- Long processing times for full dataset analysis

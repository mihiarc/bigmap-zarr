# Phase 1 Progress Report
*Updated: January 3, 2024*

## Completed Work

### 1. Infrastructure Setup ✅

#### Docker Environment
- Configured and tested three main containers:
  - PostgreSQL/PostGIS for spatial database
  - JupyterLab for data analysis
  - Processing service for data pipeline
- Implemented proper networking between containers
- Set up volume persistence for data and logs
- Configured environment variables for secure credential management

#### Database Configuration
- Installed PostGIS extensions
- Configured spatial reference systems (NC State Plane)
- Implemented spatial functions and triggers
- Set up logging with proper permissions
- Configured database optimization settings

### 2. Testing Infrastructure ✅

#### Integration Tests
- Container Communication Tests
  - PostGIS connectivity and version verification
  - JupyterLab database interaction
  - Processing service connectivity
- Volume Persistence Tests
  - Data persistence across container restarts
  - Log file persistence and monitoring
- Database Operation Tests
  - Spatial reference system verification
  - Basic CRUD operations
  - Transaction handling

#### Test Configuration
- Implemented pytest fixtures for database connections
- Set up test environment variables
- Created test data utilities
- Configured test markers for different test types

## Current Status

## Technical Debt

1. **Security**
   - Need to implement role-based access
   - Add SSL for database connections
   - Implement backup encryption

2. **Performance**
   - Optimize spatial indices
   - Configure connection pooling
   - Add query optimization

3. **Maintenance**
   - Set up automated backups
   - Configure log rotation
   - Implement health monitoring

## Dependencies

### Current
- Docker & Docker Compose
- PostgreSQL 15.3 with PostGIS 3.3
- Python 3.9+
- pytest and related testing tools

### To Be Added
- Monitoring tools
- Backup solutions
- CI/CD pipeline tools

## Notes and Recommendations

1. **Performance Considerations**
   - Monitor database connection pooling
   - Watch for memory usage in spatial operations
   - Consider adding caching layer

2. **Security Recommendations**
   - Implement database connection encryption
   - Add role-based access control
   - Set up proper backup encryption

3. **Maintenance Tasks**
   - Regular backup testing
   - Log rotation implementation
   - Performance monitoring setup

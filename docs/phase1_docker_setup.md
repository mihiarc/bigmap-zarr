   - [x] Check for any GDAL/spatial library issues ✅
   - [x] Verify Python packages installation ✅

2. Container Launch Tests
   - [x] Start all services: `docker compose up` ✅
   - [x] Verify health checks are passing ✅
   - [x] Check service logs for errors ✅
   - [x] Confirm network connectivity between containers ✅

3. Volume Mount Tests
   - [x] Verify notebook persistence in jupyter service ✅
   - [ ] Test data volume accessibility
   - [x] Confirm log file creation ✅
   - [ ] Check results directory permissions

4. JupyterLab Environment Tests
   - [x] Access JupyterLab interface ✅
   - [ ] Test Python environment
   - [ ] Verify GDAL installation
   - [ ] Test spatial libraries import
   - [ ] Create and run test notebook

### Test Phase 2: Database Integration
1. PostGIS Setup Tests
   - [ ] Verify PostGIS extensions
   - [ ] Test spatial functions
   - [ ] Check database permissions
   - [ ] Validate init scripts

2. Data Connection Tests
   - [ ] Test database connection from Jupyter
   - [ ] Test database connection from Processing
   - [ ] Verify spatial query functionality
   - [ ] Check transaction handling

### Test Phase 3: Development Workflow
1. Code Editing Tests
   - [ ] Test hot reloading
   - [ ] Verify source code changes
   - [ ] Check debugging configuration
   - [ ] Test git hooks

2. Performance Tests
   - [ ] Monitor container resource usage
   - [ ] Check volume mount performance
   - [ ] Test large dataset handling
   - [ ] Verify logging performance

### Testing Checkpoints
1. **Current Checkpoint** (After Docker Setup)
   - Must pass all Phase 1 tests before proceeding
   - Focus on container stability and access

2. **Database Checkpoint** (Before Week 2)
   - Must pass Phase 1 & 2 tests
   - Ensure data persistence and integrity

3. **Development Checkpoint** (End of Week 2)
   - Must pass all test phases
   - Verify complete workflow functionality

### Test Documentation
For each test:
1. Record test results
2. Document any issues found
3. Track resolution steps
4. Update configuration as needed

## Notes and Decisions

### Architecture Decisions
1. Using PostGIS 15-3.3 for spatial database
2. Python 3.9 as base for processing container
3. Three-container architecture:
   - PostGIS for spatial data
   - JupyterLab for analysis
   - Processing service for heavy computation

### Performance Considerations
- Volume mounts optimized for development
- Database indices for spatial queries
- Container resource allocation

### Security Notes
- Environment variable management
- Database access control
- Container isolation

## Next Steps
1. Begin with Jupyter Dockerfile creation
2. Enhance Docker Compose configuration
3. Set up development environment
4. Implement basic tests

## Questions and Issues
- [ ] Determine optimal JupyterLab extensions
- [ ] Decide on logging aggregation strategy
- [ ] Plan backup strategy for PostGIS data
- [ ] Define development workflow standards

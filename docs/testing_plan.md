## Test Implementation Plan

### Week 1: Infrastructure Testing
```python
# test_infrastructure.py
def test_container_health():
    """Verify all containers are healthy and responsive"""
    
def test_volume_persistence():
    """Ensure data persists across container restarts"""
    
def test_network_connectivity():
    """Verify inter-container communication"""
```

### Week 2: Database Testing
```python
# test_database.py
def test_spatial_operations():
    """Verify spatial operations and transformations"""
    
def test_backup_restore():
    """Test backup and restore procedures"""
    
def test_performance():
    """Benchmark common operations"""
```

### Week 3: Development Environment
```python
# test_development.py
def test_hot_reload():
    """Verify hot reload functionality"""
    
def test_debugging():
    """Test debugging configuration"""
```

## Test Execution Strategy

### 1. Automated Tests
```yaml
Frequency: On every commit
Scope:
  - Unit tests
  - Integration tests
  - Linting checks
Tools:
  - pytest
  - pre-commit
  - GitHub Actions
```

### 2. Manual Tests
```yaml
Frequency: Daily
Scope:
  - Development workflow
  - Data persistence
  - Performance checks
Documentation:
  - Test results
  - Issues found
  - Resolutions
```

### 3. Performance Tests
```yaml
Frequency: Weekly
Scope:
  - Database operations
  - Container resource usage
  - Network latency
Metrics:
  - Query response time
  - Memory usage
  - CPU utilization
```

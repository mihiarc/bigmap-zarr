# Neighbor Analysis Visualization Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the visualization strategy for analyzing and presenting the spatial relationships between heirs properties and their neighbors in Vance County, with a focus on buffer distance sensitivity analysis.

## Visualization Components

### 1. Distance Distribution Analysis

#### Core Visualizations
- Distance distribution histograms
- Kernel density estimation plots
- Summary statistics overlays

#### Implementation
```python
def plot_distance_distributions(neighbor_data):
    """
    Generate distance distribution visualizations for each buffer size.
    Shows how neighbor distances are distributed within each buffer zone.
    """
```

#### Key Metrics
- Distance ranges
- Distribution shapes
- Density patterns
- Statistical summaries

### 2. Spatial Coverage Analysis

#### Map Components
- Vance County base map
- Heirs property locations
- Neighbor density heatmaps
- Buffer zone overlays

#### Implementation
```python
def plot_spatial_coverage(spatial_data):
    """
    Create spatial visualization of coverage patterns.
    Shows geographic distribution of relationships.
    """
```

#### Analysis Layers
- Property density
- Coverage gaps
- Clustering patterns
- Edge effects

### 3. Neighbor Count Analysis

#### Visualization Types
- Bar charts (neighbors per heir)
- Box plots (across buffer distances)
- Cumulative distribution functions

#### Implementation
```python
def plot_neighbor_counts(count_data):
    """
    Analyze and visualize neighbor count distributions.
    Shows how neighbor counts scale with buffer distance.
    """
```

#### Metrics
- Count distributions
- Scaling patterns
- Outlier analysis
- Statistical tests

### 4. Comparative Property Analysis

#### Size Relationship Plots
- Heir vs neighbor size scatter plots
- Size distribution comparisons
- Area ratio analysis

#### Directional Analysis
- Rose diagrams per buffer
- Direction vs distance plots
- Spatial clustering analysis

#### Implementation
```python
def plot_comparative_analysis(property_data):
    """
    Generate comparative visualizations between heirs and neighbor properties.
    Analyzes size and directional relationships.
    """
```

### 5. Sensitivity Analysis

#### Buffer Distance Impact
- Metric trends vs distance
- Elbow curve analysis
- Statistical significance tests

#### Coverage Analysis
- Area coverage vs buffer size
- Overlap assessment
- Gap identification

#### Implementation
```python
def plot_sensitivity_analysis(buffer_data):
    """
    Analyze and visualize the impact of buffer distance choices.
    Helps identify optimal buffer sizes.
    """
```

## Technical Implementation

### 1. Core Structure
```python
class NeighborVisualizer:
    """
    Manages the creation and organization of all visualization components.
    """
    def __init__(self):
        self.setup_environment()
        self.load_data()
        self.configure_styles()
```

### 2. Required Libraries
```python
# Core visualization
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
import plotly.express as px

# Spatial visualization
import geopandas as gpd

- Multi-page PDF report
- Publication-ready SVG files

#### Interactive Elements
- Jupyter notebook with interactive plots
- HTML dashboard
- Detailed tooltips

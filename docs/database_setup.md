# PostGIS Database Setup and Configuration

## Current Status
- [x] Basic container setup
- [x] Initial database creation
- [x] PostGIS extension installation
- [x] Spatial reference system verification
- [ ] Performance tuning
- [x] User permissions setup

## Configuration Details

### Database Settings
```yaml
Host: localhost
Port: 5432
Database: heirs_property
User: postgres
Extensions: 
  - postgis
  - postgis_raster
```

### Spatial Reference Systems
```sql
-- NC State Plane (NAD83)
SRID: 2264
Authority: EPSG
Projection: Lambert Conformal Conic
Status: âœ… Configured

-- WGS 84 (Default)
SRID: 4326
Authority: EPSG
Projection: Geographic
Status: âœ… Available
```

## Performance Configuration
```yaml
shared_buffers: 2GB
work_mem: 64MB
maintenance_work_mem: 256MB
effective_cache_size: 6GB
random_page_cost: 1.1
```

## Test Results

### Initial Setup Tests (2024-01-04)
âœ… Database Creation
âœ… PostGIS Extension
âœ… Basic Connectivity
âœ… Spatial Reference System Check
âœ… Transformation Functions

### Performance Tests
ðŸ”„ Pending execution

## Issues and Resolutions

### Issue #1: Missing NC State Plane Projection
**Status**: Resolved
**Description**: SRID 2264 not available in spatial_ref_sys
**Solution**: Added custom SRS definition and transformation functions

### Issue #2: Connection Timeout in Docker
**Status**: Resolved
**Solution**: Added health check and increased startup delay

## Security Configuration

### User Roles
```sql
-- Read-only role for analysts
CREATE ROLE analyst;
GRANT SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO analyst;

-- Read-write role for data processors
CREATE ROLE processor;
GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO processor;
```

## Backup Configuration
```yaml
Frequency: Daily
Retention: 7 days
Location: /backup/postgres
Type: Full backup + WAL archiving
```

## Next Steps
1. âœ… Complete spatial reference system setup
2. Implement automated backup solution
3. Configure replication (if needed)
4. Set up monitoring
5. Performance testing with sample data
